# Python
Even though I made the 'anime searcher' project for CS50 where I used Python, I was still lacking some fundaments. That's what I want to improve here.

## What can you expect to find here?

Well, mainly simple exercises to practice the fundaments and some bigger projects. *Some of them might have their own repo eventually if I find them interesting enough.*

## How is this repo sort?

The dictionary *Hello world* may be the more confussing, to make long story short, it's bassically where all the fundaments and code covering only new concepts are, things like *standar library* have just code showing fundaments about them. 

Ouside *Hello world* are some dictionaries with a bit more complex code, covering either bigger exercies or some challenges I saw somewhere else and I wanted to challenge myself with them. 
In *random exercises* are precisely that kind of code.
